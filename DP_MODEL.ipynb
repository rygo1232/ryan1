        "\n",
        "The deep learning models—Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks with LSTM (RNN), and Autoencoders with GAN-like principles—have been developed to identify latent operational risk factors that traditional methods, such as simple statistical thresholds, often miss due to their inability to capture non-linear and temporal dependencies. These models were trained on a dataset spanning 1980–2025, with preprocessing steps like normalization and reshaping applied to leverage its time-series nature. An ensemble approach, combining predictions from all models, was implemented to enhance detection robustness. Synthetic anomalies (5% rate) were injected into the test set (derived from a 45-sample dataset) to evaluate performance, revealing the models' potential to uncover hidden risks, though limitations in dataset size and anomaly rate impacted results.\n",

        "**Ensemble Anomaly Detection**\n",
        "\n",
        "The ensemble anomaly detection plot demonstrates the model's capability to identify latent risks by showing reconstruction errors across test samples, with a threshold of approximately 15 (95th percentile) marking anomalies. One sample (index 7) exceeds this threshold with an error of about 25, indicating a significant latent risk factor. The corresponding test data plot highlights this anomaly in red (normalized value ~2.0), while other samples (green, -1.0 to 1.0) are classified as normal. This showcases the ensemble's strength in capturing complex patterns, surpassing traditional methods. However, the low precision, recall, and F1-score (0.11) suggest under-detection, likely due to the small dataset and low anomaly rate. Adjusting the threshold or increasing the anomaly rate could improve sensitivity.\n",

Training times (e.g., 95 ms/step for BNN, 85 ms/step for CNN) confirm efficient execution, but the low F1-score highlights the need for tuning. The small dataset (45 samples) and 5% synthetic anomaly rate likely restrict robust learning, suggesting that expanding the dataset or adjusting the anomaly injection could enhance detection accuracy.\n",

The absence of false positives and negatives aligns with the low 0.11 F1-score, indicating significant under-detection due to the conservative 95th percentile threshold and limited dataset (45 samples) with a 5% anomaly rate. This suggests the model misses many latent risks, an area where traditional methods also falter. Lowering the threshold or increasing the anomaly rate could boost sensitivity.\n",

This prioritization, which traditional methods like simple averages miss, reveals non-linear relationships, though the narrow score range (0.12–0.16) suggests the Autoencoder’s limited ability to differentiate critical factors, potentially due to dataset size.
